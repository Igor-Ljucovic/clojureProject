## Ideas for future development of the app:

1 (done) - add more output parameters (game dev, IT support, mobile dev, etc.)  

2 (done) - add validation  

3 - add more input parameters other then just asking the users how interesting they find certain topics (mandatory parameters for if they enjoy stale or dynamic working environment, how much social interaction they would prefer at the job, optional parameters for MBTI/BIG5, "collecting candidate features", maybe some more non-numeric input parameters too) (probably unnecessary complexity)

4 - add 2 options at the beginning so that the user can:  
    a - ask for the expert system prediction
    b - ask for the machine learning algorithm prediction

5 - (done) add non-manual validation (for employed users' data)  

6 - (done) instead of just having certain string, also add percentages to these predictions (56% DevOps, 29% web dev, etc.)  

7 - maybe make the entire output into 1 file or into 1 nice picture with descriptive statistics, maybe by using some API (probably unnecessary)

8 - maybe use an OpenAI API or something like that for formatting that output based on the percentages for job positions (probably unnecessary)  

9 - maybe add an actual graphical interface (probably unnecessary)

10 - (done) maybe add some automated testing or some type of automation if possible
