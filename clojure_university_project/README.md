## Ideas for future development of the app:

1 (done) - add more output parameters (game dev, it support, mobile dev etc.)  

2 (partially done) - add validation  

3 - add more input parameters other then just asking the users how interesting they find certain topics (mandatory parameters for if they enjoy stale or dynamic working environment, how much social interaction they would prefer at the job, optional parameters for MBTI/BIG5, "collecting candidate features", maybe some non-numeric input parameters too)  

4 - add more options at the beginning so that the user can:  
    a - ask for a prediction of which IT position suits them best (if they are unemployed)  
    b - add new data for better predictions (if they are already employed) (this will require a database and connecting to it (probably))  

5 - add non-manual validation (for employed users' data)  

6 - instead of just having certain string, also add percentages to these predictions (86% DevOps, 34% web dev etc.)  

7 - maybe make the entire output into 1 file or into 1 nice picture with descriptive statistics, maybe by using some API  

8 - have specific messages (mini roadmap, or technology examples) about certain combinations/percentages in the output  

9 - maybe use an OpenAI API or something like that for formatting that output based on the percentages for job positions  

10 - maybe add an actual graphical interface  

11 - maybe add an option to log in (probably unnecessary for this type of app)  

12 - maybe add some automated testing or some type of automation if possible
